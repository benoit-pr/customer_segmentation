# Customer Segmentation Project

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to perform customer segmentation using the available data to differentiate between high and low-value customers based on their orders and satisfaction levels. The segmentation should be practical and user-friendly for the Marketing team.

## Data Source

- **Dataset**: [Download Dataset](https://course.oc-static.com/projects/olist.db)

## Objectives

1. **Data Analysis**:
   - Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand the dataset and prepare it for segmentation.

2. **Segmentation**:
   - Implement and evaluate different customer segmentation methods.
   - The segmentation should effectively categorize customers into meaningful groups, distinguishing between those with high and low performance in terms of orders and satisfaction.

3. **Recommendation for Updates**:
   - After selecting the most appropriate segmentation model, recommend a frequency for updating the segmentation to ensure its relevance over time. This will help in preparing a maintenance contract.

## Notebooks

1. **Notebook 1: EDA**:
   - Explore and analyze the data.
   - Prepare the data for further processing and segmentation.

2. **Notebook 2: Segmentation Methods**:
   - Explore and apply various segmentation techniques, including RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) analysis and other methods.
   - Evaluate the effectiveness of different models for customer segmentation.

3. **Notebook 3: Model Update Simulation**:
   - Simulate scenarios to determine the optimal frequency for updating the segmentation model.
   - Ensure that the model remains useful and relevant over time.
